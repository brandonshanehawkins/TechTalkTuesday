# GizmoGraph Backlog & Idea Tracker

Welcome to the backlog! Whenever you have a "shower thought" or a cool idea while tinkering with GizmoGraph, just drop it in here. 

When you're ready to have me (Antigravity) build some of these out, just say: 
*"Hey, let's tackle the top 3 items in the backlog today!"*

## 🟢 New Ideas / Feature Requests
*(Add your ideas here as bullet points or checkboxes)*
## 🟡 In Progress
*(I will move items here when we start actively working on them)*

## 🔵 Completed
*(A history of the awesome stuff we've built from this list)*
- [x] Create a Note Node that can display a larger, wrapped text field; for explanations or scratchpad thoughts, etc.
- [x] Create a new custom node that has the TTT brand colors coded in, or even better, TTT brand colors by defualt, but the fields are editable for use with other color themes. Each color should have an output wire.
- [x] I like 'Combine Elements' node you added... I want an 'element' node intended for the 'Combine Elements' (HTML Container node added with justification options).
- [x] I'm not sure if the save image node is working like I had hoped. Is there a node that needs to go between to make 'pixels' for the save image node? (Added Render To Image Node).
- [x] Create a Markdown Node that accepts markdown text and renders it as HTML for presentation.
- [x] The nodes based on #FFA500 should have dark text, if possible, for legibility
- [x] Create a Graph Name field or button; Save Graph should use this as filename for graph state saves.
- [x] Document under-the-hood LiteGraph details vs Custom GizmoGraph nodes (Answered question about Crop/Python backend).
- [x] Initial GizmoGraph Vite architecture.
- [x] Custom LiteGraph `gizmo` node categories.
- [x] Dual-window `BroadcastChannel` presentation mode.
- [x] Multi-element Scene Builder operator.
